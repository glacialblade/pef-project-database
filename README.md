PEF Projects Database
=====================

This is a project under Philippine Equity Foundation, not to be duplicated or reproduced in anyway

Setup Notes:
- since the actual server is hard to control, we'll use a local database server that will be initially populated by an sql file that is provided here
- you can use the following access when using the application (admin:password)

Development Notes:
- secure folder should be outside the public_html directory for safe keeping, we'll use the current directory for now
- screenshots folder is a graphical representation of the interface, not all interface will be followed to the letter but if it doesn't, the solution should not be too far from the original

Modules:

USERS
- add feature is already available
- display feature is ready available
- modify feature is still under development
